                <span class="details">
                    The engine of the S 1000 XR is based on the high-performance engine of the RR and was optimized
                    according to the XR for uncompromising long-distance performance: among other things, special
                    camshaft profiles and designated manifolds deliver impressive torque from the middle and the widest
                    usable speed range in its class. The longer gearbox in the upper gears ensures smooth running –
                    which you can feel and hear.
